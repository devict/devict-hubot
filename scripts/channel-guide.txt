*Channel Guide*
Welcome to devICT Slack! This Slack team is the primary way we execute our mission to

>*Educate, Empower, and Connect software developers in the Wichita area*.

This is a vibrant and active community. Conversations are split into channels. Using channels enables us to hold many conversations at once and enables _you_ to subscribe to topics that match your interests.

The number of channels in this community may seem overwhelming so we periodically archive inactive or unused channels. To help you make the most of this community we have created this guide!

Browse through these pages and if something catches your eye click on the channel name for a preview. If you want to join, click "Join Channel" to keep that channel around, then come back to this message to find more!

*Core Channels*
>These are the default channels. You may still choose to `/leave` any of them, except #general; nobody can leave that! :laughing:

*#general*: The *primary place for conversations*. If a discussion is more appropriate in another channel then you may be asked to move it there, but that’s *no big deal*.

_If you need to focus you can mute the channel with `/mute` or sign out for a while. That’s OK!_

*#random*: Cat pictures, funny YouTube videos, links to some weird site you found, etc. Any topic is appropriate here (within the Code of Conduct).

*#events*: See or post announcements of upcoming community events. These don't have to be devICT events.

*#job-postings*: See or post job openings. Active job-seekers may configure this channel to send notifications, so keep chatter to a minimum. Questions/comments in response to a particular job posting are fine, but try to keep them threaded on the job post itself.

*#career-advice*: Give or receive advice about career advancement. This is a great place for discussions/questions.

*#review-feedback*: Help others or get some help yourself! Constructive criticism only of course :smile:

*#suggestions*: Suggest changes for devICT. These can go in #general too, but they're easier to keep track of here.

_The rest of these channels are opt-in: you won't be in them by default so you have to join if they sound neat :neature:_

*Languages and Frameworks*
>These channels are for questions/discussions about a specific programming language or framework. :code:
