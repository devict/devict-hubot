*Channel Guide*
Welcome to devICT Slack! This is a vibrant and active community. Conversations are split into channels. Using channels enables us to have many different conversations happening at once, and enables _you_ to subscribe to topics that match your interests.

As our community grows, the increasing number of channels may seem overwhelming. We periodically archive inactive or unused channels to combat this. To help you make the most of this community, we have created this guide to our channels.

Browse through these and if something catches your eye click on the channel name for a preview. If you want to join, click "Join Channel" to keep that channel around, then come back to this message to find more!

*Core Channels*
>Everyone starts out in these channels, though you may choose to `/leave` if it's not your thing. Except #general; nobody can leave that muahahaha!

*#general*: All members are in this channel and it is the *primary place for conversations*. If a long conversation would be more appropriate in another channel (like WordPress questions in #wordpress), then you may be asked to move the conversation there, but that's *no big deal*.

_If you need to focus or the conversation here is too distracting, you can mute the channel with `/mute` or just sign out for a while. That's OK!_

*#random*: Cat pictures, funny YouTube videos, links to some weird website you found, etc. Any topic is appropriate here (within the CoC of course). If you have something to share but it just really feels... "random" then go ahead and throw it here.

*#events*: See or post announcements of upcoming community events. These don't have to be devICT events.

*#job-postings*: See or post job openings. Active job-seekers can configure this channel to always send them notifications, so keep chatter to a minimum. Questions/comments in response to a particular job posting are fine, but try to keep them threaded on the job post itself.

*#career-advice*: Give or receive advice about career advancement. This is a great place for discussions/questions.

*#review-feedback*: Help others or get some help yourself! Constructive criticism only of course :smile:

*#suggestions*: A place to suggest changes for the devICT Slack or community. These can go in #general too, but they're easier to keep track of here.
