*Channel Guide*
Welcome to devICT Slack! This is a vibrant and active community though you might not see all of the activity because conversations are split into channels. Using channels enables us to have many different conversations happening at once. Channels also allow you to subscribe to topics that match your interests.

As our community grows the number of channels grows as well. We periodically archive inactive or unused channels to keep this managable but it can still be a bit overwhelming. To help you make the most of this community we have created this guide to our channels.

Browse through these and if something catches your eye click on the channel name for a preview. If you want to join click "Join Channel" to keep that channel around. Come back to this message to look for more.

*Core Channels*
>Everyone starts out in these channels though you may choose to `/leave` if its not your thing. Except #general; nobody can leave that muahahaha!

*#general*: All members are in this channel and it is the *primary place for conversations*. If a long conversation would be more appropriate in another channel (like WordPress questions in #wordpress) then you may be asked to move the conversation there but that's *no big deal*.

_If you need to focus and conversation here is too distracting you can mute the channel with `/mute` or just sign out for a while. That's ok!._

*#random*: Cat pictures, funny YouTube videos, links to some weird website you found, etc. Any topic is appropriate here (within the CoC of course). If you have something to share but it just really feels... "random" then go ahead and throw it here.

*#events*: See or post announcements of upcoming community events. These don't have to be devICT events.

*#job-postings*: See or post job openings. Active job-seekers can configure this channel to always send them notifications so keep chatter to a minimum. Questions/comments in response to a particular job posting are fine but try to keep them threaded on the job post itself.

*#career-advice*: Give or receive advice about career advancement. This is a great place for discussions / questions that you might be tempted to put in the jobs channel.

*#review-feedback*: Help others or get some help yourself! Constructive criticism only of course :smile:

*#suggestions*: A place to suggest changes for the devICT Slack or community. These can go in #general too of course but they're less likely to get missed here.
